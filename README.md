# Vison-Task

## Intro
**We implemented two operations in this project**  
**1- imageThresholding**
**2- image Filters and Kernel Convolution Visually** 

## ImageThresholding

### what is image thresholding?
**  thresholding is the simplest method of segmenting images. From a grayscale image, thresholding can be used to create binary images.**
